#   scripts/pr-land-bg.sh            # launch in a tmux window, print how to watch it
#   scripts/pr-land-bg.sh --status   # is a lander running for THIS worktree?
#   scripts/pr-land-bg.sh --kill     # stop THIS worktree's lander, wrapper and child
#   scripts/pr-land-bg.sh --attach   # watch the window
#
# Two things this exists to stop, both of which cost a real batch real hours:
#
# 1. A backgrounded lander gets reaped. `pnpm pr:land` polls CI for as long as the
#    heavy lane makes it, and `setsid nohup … &` did NOT survive — three landers
#    died mid-poll in one night, each leaving `EXIT=143` in a log. 143 is SIGTERM:
#    it says the process was killed, NOT that the PR reached a state. A tmux
#    window survives, and keeps the output to read afterwards.
#
# 2. Killing a lander by pattern kills everybody's. `pkill -f`/`pgrep -f` match
#    the calling shell too (that is the mystery exit 144), and every worktree on
#    this machine runs its own lander during a batch — one sweep took out three.
#    Worse, killing the pnpm wrapper alone ORPHANS the `node scripts/pr-land.js`
#    child, which keeps polling and can merge a head that lacks your latest
#    commit while your log says the run died.

# --kill built on that would kill the agent instead of the lander.
#
# So: read argv from /proc/<pid>/cmdline, split on NUL, require argv[0] to be a
# shell or node rather than anything that merely quotes the path, and require an
# argument that IS the script. Then filter by cwd. `readlink` on another user's
# pid fails and a pid can exit mid-scan: both are skipped, never fatal, or a
# stale pid would abort a --kill that has real work to do.
