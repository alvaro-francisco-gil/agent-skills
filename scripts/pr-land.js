/**
 * `pnpm pr:land` — the autonomous landing loop.
 *
 * NOT a merge command, and no longer a pipeline. A **reconciler**: each iteration
 * observes the world, asks `decide.js` what the world now needs, and performs
 * exactly one action. It never remembers what it did, so it cannot be wrong about
 * it. Kill it anywhere and re-run — it resumes, because it never assumed where it
 * was.
 *
 *   0   merged and the remote branch is gone
 *   10  CI red, or the merge result fails `integrationCheck` (output printed) — fix, re-run
 *   20  review requested changes (findings printed) — fix the cause, re-run
 *   30  hard-stop, draft, closed, a deadline, or (unless the repo sets
 *       `roundsExhausted: "merge"`) rounds exhausted — hand to a human
 *   40  preflight failed (dirty tree, protected branch, conflict) — resolve, re-run
 *
 * Why a reconciler. The pipeline version accumulated ten bugs in its first day and
 * not one was in the logic deciding whether a PR may merge. Every one was in
 * PERCEPTION — reading a tool's exit code as a statement about the world.
 * `gh pr checks` exits non-zero for "no checks yet", "network down" and "checks
 * failed" alike. `gh pr merge --delete-branch` exited non-zero *after a successful
 * merge*, because a local checkout failed afterwards, and reported a landed PR as
 * a failure.
 *
 * The rule that kills the whole class: **never infer domain state from a tool's
 * exit code — query it.** Here that is structural rather than a discipline each
 * author has to remember. A failed observation is *no new information*, not a
 * verdict; the loop simply looks again. Idempotence is not a feature that was
 * added, it is the shape: "already merged" is just an observation whose gap to the
 * desired state is empty.
 *
 * Three guards are judgement rather than perception, so they live here:
 *
 * - **Vacuous green is not green.** CI is usually path-filtered, so a PR touching
 *   only docs or infra dispatches no run at all. Such a PR is marked UNVERIFIED in
 *   its body and rests on review alone.
 * - **Staleness is semantic, not chronological.** Rebase only when the base
 *   changed a file this PR also changes, and do it before any wait rather than
 *   after green + approved. A base that moved only through the shared blast
 *   radius is answered by `integrationCheck` on the merge result, locally — see
 *   `baseMovement`.
 * - **A lane that never ran is not a lane that passed.** GitHub reports "skipped
 *   by a path filter" and "skipped because my dependency died" with the same
 *   word, and only the second can merge an unvalidated diff. See `checksVerdict`.
 *
 * All repo-specific values are DATA, in `.agents/land.config.json`. This file is
 * shared verbatim across repos via the `agent-skills` submodule; if you are
 * editing it for one repo, that value belongs in that repo's config instead.

//       "Build image + deploy to Cloud Run" (`if: github.event_name == 'push'`)
//       are skipped by design on every PR. Blocking on these would wedge nearly
//       every PR in every consuming repo.
//   (b) DEPENDENCY CASCADE — a `needs:` upstream failed or was cancelled, so
//       GitHub skipped this job. The lane never ran. This is the one shape of
//       "not red" that can merge a diff no test ever looked at.
//
// The job API does not say which. Verified against the live incident: the
// cascaded skip (Emulators, run 33126802372) and the path-filtered skip (Cloud
// Run deploy, run 33126802218) on the same head SHA are byte-identical in
// `/actions/jobs/<id>` — conclusion `skipped`, `runner_name` null, `steps` [],
// degenerate timestamps. Nothing local to the job distinguishes them.
//
// What does distinguish them is the run they sit in. `needs:` cannot cross
// workflows, so a cascade's cause is always a sibling job in the SAME run.
// Hence: a skipped check is a cascade suspect iff its own run contains a job
// that reached a terminal non-success conclusion. On the fixtures that
// separates the two cases exactly — the CI run held the failure and both
// cascaded skips; the Web run held only successes and the legitimate skip.
//
// This is deliberately coarser than walking `needs:` through the workflow YAML.
// Its imprecision is one-directional and cheap: a run holding an unrelated
// failure *and* an unrelated legitimate skip over-blocks — but such a run is
// already red, so the verdict does not change. It buys that with no YAML
// parsing, no display-name matching (`name: Audit ${{ matrix.env }}` does not
// match anything), and no extra API call: `gh pr checks` already reports the
