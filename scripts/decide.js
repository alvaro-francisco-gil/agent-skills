/**
 * The decision table. PURE — no network, no filesystem, no clock of its own.
 *
 * This file exists because of how `pr-land` failed in practice. Ten bugs in its
 * first day, and not one was in the logic deciding whether a PR may merge. Every
 * one was in PERCEPTION: reading a tool's exit code as if it described the world.
 * `gh pr checks` returns non-zero for "no checks yet", "network down" and "checks
 * failed" alike; `gh pr merge --delete-branch` returned non-zero *after a
 * successful merge* because a local checkout failed afterwards.
 *
 * So the loop is level-triggered, not edge-triggered. It does not remember what
 * it did; each iteration observes the world, asks this function what the world
 * now needs, and does exactly one thing. "Already merged" is not a special case —
 * it is simply an observation whose gap to the desired state is empty.
 *
 * Desired state: the branch is merged into the base, and its remote ref is gone.
 *
 * Keeping this pure is the point: the whole table is testable without a network,
 * which is exactly what the pipeline version made impossible.
